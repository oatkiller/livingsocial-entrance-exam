I made the background image fixed to the width of the window. This allows the background image to take up the whole screen regardless of the width of the browser. Combined with the black background of the page, the image presentation is always good. I used web fonts to render the elements that use Arial Black. This way I can avoid using a lot of images for those elements. I used borders and CSS gradients for several elements, allowing me to avoid using elements. I combined the living social logo and the blue triangle into one image (sprite technique) to reduce HTTP requests. I implemented the tabs as links, because I think that no complicated interaction is necessary for the page.
